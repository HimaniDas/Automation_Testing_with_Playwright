# 🎭 Automation Testing with Playwright

This project demonstrates end-to-end automation testing of a sample e-commerce site using **Playwright** with JavaScript. It follows industry-standard practices including the Page Object Model (POM), reusable test data, GitHub Actions CI integration, and comprehensive test coverage of different user roles.

## 🧰 Utility

- `test-data.js`: Stores test users and static input data
